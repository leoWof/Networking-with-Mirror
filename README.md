# Networking-with-Mirror
A basic implementation of a networked game with Mirror in Unity.


1- Open two instances of the game. 
2- Choose to host on one of the instance, and to be a client on the second one. 


When the scene will be open, click on one of the cube and press 'a' to spawn your player. 
To move, use the arrow. 
To shot, use spaceBar.
